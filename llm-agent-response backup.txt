"user prompt: Use the online researcher to write a report on Agentic Behavior. \n\nResponse: \n\n\nAgentic behavior refers to actions initiated by individuals who perceive themselves as autonomous agents, capable of making independent choices and exerting control over their environment. This concept is central to various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n**Psychological Perspective**\n\nIn psychology, agentic behavior is closely linked to the sense of agency—the feeling of being in control of one's actions and their outcomes. Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory emphasizes human agency, highlighting individuals' capacity to influence their circumstances through intentional actions. Recent studies have explored the relationship between agency and behavioral characteristics. For instance, research involving adolescents found a negative correlation between agency and conformity, and a positive correlation between agency and the need for cognition. This suggests that higher agency is associated with a greater inclination towards independent thinking and problem-solving. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410170/full?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, studies have examined how obedience affects the sense of agency. Research indicates that coercion can diminish the sense of agency by increasing the perceived time between an individual's action and its outcome, a phenomenon known as \"temporal binding.\" This effect underscores the impact of external pressures on personal agency. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039144/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Agentic AI**\n\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, agentic AI refers to systems capable of autonomous decision-making and action without human intervention. These systems utilize advanced AI techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning, to perform tasks ranging from software development to customer support. The evolution of agentic AI has led to the development of autonomous software agents that can understand user preferences, initiate actions, and make decisions across digital environments. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe concept of the \"agentic web\" represents an evolution of the internet, characterized by the integration of these autonomous agents. This development aims to enhance user experiences by enabling systems to perform tasks on behalf of users, thereby reducing the need for direct human input. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_web?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Agentic Leadership**\n\nAgentic leadership is a contemporary framework that integrates traditional leadership principles with AI capabilities. Introduced by Kashif Zaman in 2024, this model positions AI as a tool to enhance leadership qualities such as empathy, transparency, and decision-making. The framework outlines ten metaphoric AI companions designed to augment various aspects of leadership, advocating for the use of AI beyond operational efficiency to transform leadership culture and decision-making processes. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_leadership?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Measuring Agency**\n\nAssessing individual agency has been a focus of recent research. A comprehensive literature review highlighted the lack of consensus on defining and measuring agency, noting that various instruments have been used to evaluate this construct. The review emphasizes the need for standardized measures to better understand agency across different contexts and populations. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02791-8?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAgentic behavior encompasses the capacity for autonomous action and decision-making, a concept that spans multiple disciplines. In psychology, it relates to the sense of personal control and its influence on behavior. In AI, it pertains to the development of systems capable of independent operation. The integration of agentic principles into leadership and technology continues to evolve, highlighting the importance of understanding and measuring agency in various contexts. user prompt: Using the report from the online researcher, write an article using the 'blog manager'. \n\nResponse: \n\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Agentic Behavior: From Psychology to Artificial Intelligence\n\nAgentic behavior, a critical concept in both human psychology and technology, describes the capacity for autonomous action—when individuals or systems act independently and exert control over their environment. At its core, agentic behavior is about self-determination and the power to influence one’s circumstances through intentional choices. This notion is particularly central to Albert Bandura’s social cognitive theory, which emphasizes human agency as the key driver of behavior. Notably, research among adolescents has found that a strong sense of agency is negatively correlated with conformity and positively associated with the need for independent thought and problem-solving. This means individuals who perceive themselves as more agentic are less likely to simply follow the crowd and are more likely to seek out and enjoy cognitive challenges ([Frontiers in Psychology, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410170/full?utm_source=openai)).\n\nThe experience of agency changes under external pressures or coercive environments. Recent studies illustrate that when people are obeying orders rather than acting freely, their sense of agency—the subjective feeling of control over their own actions—can diminish. This is observed through “temporal binding,” a psychological effect where the perceived time between an action and its outcome becomes elongated, reducing the individual’s sense of ownership over the results ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039144/?utm_source=openai)). Such findings highlight the importance of maintaining environments that foster autonomy and reduce undue external pressure, whether in organizational, educational, or social settings.\n\nAgentic behavior’s significance has only grown with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). In this domain, *agentic AI* refers to autonomous systems capable of making independent decisions and acting without direct human oversight. These smart agents are transforming digital experiences, from automating customer support to managing complex organizational tasks. The “agentic web,” a new paradigm fueled by such autonomous agents, promises to further diminish routine user intervention and enhance overall digital experiences ([Wikipedia - Agentic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI?utm_source=openai); [Wikipedia - Agentic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_web?utm_source=openai)). Moreover, agentic leadership—a contemporary model blending human leadership values with AI’s analytical prowess—reflects the next evolution in leveraging agency for better organizational outcomes ([Wikipedia - Agentic Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_leadership?utm_source=openai)).\n\nDespite its wide-ranging importance, experts still debate how best to define and measure agency. Recent reviews have pointed out the variety of tools used to assess agentic behavior and called for greater consensus to ensure clarity and comparability across studies ([Springer, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02791-8?utm_source=openai)). As both human and artificial agency become more prominent in society, developing standardized measures will be essential for harnessing their positive potential and understanding their impact.\n\n**In summary**, agentic behavior lies at the intersection of independent thought, action, and technological advancement. Its implications touch everything from individual psychology and leadership models to the future of AI-driven systems—making it a vital concept for shaping our understanding of personal autonomy and digital innovation.\n\n---user prompt: Meticulously review and harmonize the final output from both the 'blog manager' and 'online researcher' \n\nResponse: \n\n\nHere is a meticulous review and harmonization of the article, ensuring clarity, cohesion, high editorial quality, and seamless narrative flow.

At its essence, agentic behavior is characterized by self-determination—the ability to make intentional choices and exert control over one’s environment. In psychology, this is foundational to the sense of agency, a theme extensively explored by Albert Bandura’s social cognitive theory. Recent research among adolescents uncovers that individuals with a robust sense of agency are less prone to conformity and more disposed to seek cognitive challenges, suggesting that agency fuels independent thought and a drive for problem-solving ([Frontiers in Psychology, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410170/full?utm_source=openai)).\n\nEnvironmental pressures, such as coercion or rigid instructions, have been shown to suppress an individual’s sense of agency. Compelling evidence indicates that when individuals act under orders, their subjective control—or agency—wanes. Researchers attribute this diminished agency to the phenomenon of \"temporal binding,\" where the perceived link between one’s action and its outcome is stretched, leading to a reduced sense of ownership over the results ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039144/?utm_source=openai)). This insight underscores the importance of fostering autonomy and agency-supportive climates in workplaces, schools, and other social institutions.\n\nAgentic behavior’s influence now extends powerfully into the digital era, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). *Agentic AI* refers to sophisticated AI systems capable of independent operations—making decisions, taking actions, and adapting to complex environments with little to no human oversight. The emergence of such autonomous software agents is transforming digital experiences and workflows, forming what is termed the \"agentic web.\" This paradigm promises a future where digital agents can anticipate user needs and perform tasks proactively, minimizing the need for direct commands ([Wikipedia - Agentic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI?utm_source=openai); [Wikipedia - Agentic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_web?utm_source=openai)). Leadership is evolving alongside these advances, with the new framework of agentic leadership integrating AI to augment key human qualities such as empathy, transparency, and informed decision-making ([Wikipedia - Agentic Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_leadership?utm_source=openai)). \n\nDespite its growing relevance, the scientific community continues to deliberate on the most effective ways to conceptualize and measure agency. Comprehensive reviews have pointed out the diversity of instruments used to assess agentic behavior, calling for validated, standardized approaches that can facilitate robust comparisons across research contexts and populations ([Springer, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02791-8?utm_source=openai)).\n\n**In summary**, the study and application of agentic behavior illuminate the profound interplay between autonomy, motivation, and technology. From supporting individual growth and ethical leadership to shaping the future of intelligent digital systems, agentic behavior remains a central pillar in our journey toward empowerment and innovation.\n\n---\n\nThis article is ready for publication.
