Findings indicated a negative relationship between agency and conformity, a positive relationship with problematic behavior, and a stronger positive relationship with the need for cognition. These results suggest that as adolescents develop a sense of agency, they may be less inclined to conform and more driven by cognitive engagement.

A study found that coercion increases the perceived time between an action and its outcome, suggesting a diminished sense of agency under forced conditions. This aligns with the concept of an \\\"agentic shift,\\\" where individuals in obedient roles feel less personal responsibility for their actions.

A study on first encounters revealed that individuals who display communal behaviors are generally more popular. However, those exhibiting agentic behaviors can also gain popularity, indicating that agency contributes positively to social perceptions.

Findings indicated a negative relationship between agency and conformity, a positive relationship with problematic behavior, and a stronger positive relationship with the need for cognition. These results suggest that as adolescents develop a sense of agency, they may be less inclined to conform and more driven by cognitive engagement.

A study found that coercion increases the perceived time between an action and its outcome, suggesting a diminished sense of agency under forced conditions. This aligns with the concept of an \\\"agentic shift,\\\" where individuals in obedient roles feel less personal responsibility for their actions.

A study on first encounters revealed that individuals who display communal behaviors are generally more popular. However, those exhibiting agentic behaviors can also gain popularity, indicating that agency contributes positively to social perceptions. Conversely, excessive agentic behavior toward specific individuals may lead to unique dislike, highlighting the nuanced role of agency in interpersonal relationships.

Individuals exhibiting agentic behavior take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their environment, reflecting a sense of personal agency. This concept is pivotal in psychology, sociology, and artificial intelligence (AI), influencing our understanding of human behavior and the development of autonomous systems.\\n\\n**Agentic Behavior in Human Psychology**\\n\\nIn psychological terms, agentic behavior is closely linked to the sense of agency—the feeling of control over one's actions and their outcomes. Research has explored various dimensions of this concept:\\n\\n- **Adolescent Agency**: A study introduced the Adolescent Agency Index to measure agency among students in grades 4 to 8. Findings indicated a negative relationship between agency and conformity, a positive relationship with problematic behavior, and a stronger positive relationship with the need for cognition. These results suggest that as adolescents develop a sense of agency, they may be less inclined to conform and more driven by cognitive engagement. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410170/full?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n- **Obedience and Agency**: Research has examined how obedience affects the sense of agency. A study found that coercion increases the perceived time between an action and its outcome, suggesting a diminished sense of agency under forced conditions. This aligns with the concept of an \\\"agentic shift,\\\" where individuals in obedient roles feel less personal responsibility for their actions. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039144/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n- **Social Interactions**: Agentic behavior also influences social dynamics. A study on first encounters revealed that individuals who display communal behaviors are generally more popular. However, those exhibiting agentic behaviors can also gain popularity, indicating that agency contributes positively to social perceptions. Conversely, excessive agentic behavior toward specific individuals may lead to unique dislike, highlighting the nuanced role of agency in interpersonal relationships. ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976221147258?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Agentic Behavior in Artificial Intelligence**\\n\\nIn AI, agentic behavior pertains to systems capable of autonomous planning and action. The evolution from traditional, narrow AI to Agentic AI involves creating systems composed of specialized, autonomous agents that interact and cooperate, mirroring human cognitive processes. This approach enhances efficiency and adaptability across various domains, including healthcare, banking, and logistics. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/brainpower-unleashed-agentic-ai-and-beyond-bots?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nHowever, deploying agentic AI systems presents challenges in aligning their behavior with diverse human values and safety requirements.

Individuals exhibiting agentic behavior take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their environment, reflecting a sense of personal agency. This concept is pivotal in psychology, sociology, and artificial intelligence (AI), influencing our understanding of human behavior and the development of autonomous systems.\\n\\n**Agentic Behavior in Human Psychology**\\n\\nIn psychological terms, agentic behavior is closely linked to the sense of agency—the feeling of control over one's actions and their outcomes. Research has explored various dimensions of this concept:\\n\\n- **Adolescent Agency**: A study introduced the Adolescent Agency Index to measure agency among students in grades 4 to 8. Findings indicated a negative relationship between agency and conformity, a positive relationship with problematic behavior, and a stronger positive relationship with the need for cognition. These results suggest that as adolescents develop a sense of agency, they may be less inclined to conform and more driven by cognitive engagement. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1410170/full?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n- **Obedience and Agency**: Research has examined how obedience affects the sense of agency. A study found that coercion increases the perceived time between an action and its outcome, suggesting a diminished sense of agency under forced conditions. This aligns with the concept of an \\\"agentic shift,\\\" where individuals in obedient roles feel less personal responsibility for their actions. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039144/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n- **Social Interactions**: Agentic behavior also influences social dynamics. A study on first encounters revealed that individuals who display communal behaviors are generally more popular. However, those exhibiting agentic behaviors can also gain popularity, indicating that agency contributes positively to social perceptions. Conversely, excessive agentic behavior toward specific individuals may lead to unique dislike, highlighting the nuanced role of agency in interpersonal relationships. ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976221147258?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Agentic Behavior in Artificial Intelligence**\\n\\nIn AI, agentic behavior pertains to systems capable of autonomous planning and action. The evolution from traditional, narrow AI to Agentic AI involves creating systems composed of specialized, autonomous agents that interact and cooperate, mirroring human cognitive processes. This approach enhances efficiency and adaptability across various domains, including healthcare, banking, and logistics. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/brainpower-unleashed-agentic-ai-and-beyond-bots?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nHowever, deploying agentic AI systems presents challenges in aligning their behavior with diverse human values and safety requirements. To address this, researchers have proposed frameworks like the \\\"superego\\\" agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism that dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected \\\"Creed Constitutions.\\\" This system aims to ensure AI behavior aligns with individual and cultural contexts, enhancing safety and reliability. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13774?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nAdditionally, the robustness of agentic workflows is a critical concern. Studies have shown that even advanced AI agents are vulnerable to deceptive feedback, which can lead to incorrect decisions. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential for developing more resilient agentic systems. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03332?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Measuring Agentic Behavior**\\n\\nAssessing agentic behavior involves various instruments and scales. A literature review highlighted the lack of consensus on defining and measuring agency, noting that terms like \\\"self-efficacy,\\\" \\\"personal autonomy,\\\" and \\\"internal locus of control\\\" are often used interchangeably. The review emphasized the need for comprehensive tools to evaluate agency across different contexts and populations, which is crucial for understanding human functioning and designing interventions aimed at empowerment. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02791-8?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAgentic behavior is a multifaceted concept encompassing the capacity for autonomous action and decision-making in both humans and AI systems. In psychology, it influences conformity, cognitive engagement, and social interactions. In AI, it drives the development of autonomous systems that require careful alignment with human values and safety standards. Ongoing research continues to explore and address the complexities associated with agentic behavior across these domains.\\n\\n\\n## Advancements in Agentic AI and Human Agency Research:\\n- [Brainpower unleashed: agentic AI and beyond bots](https://www.techradar.com/pro/brainpower-unleashed-agentic-ai-and-beyond-bots?utm_source=openai) \"}]},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"\\n      Using the report from the online researcher, write an article using the 'blog manager'. \\n      The publication should contain links to sources stated by the online researcher. \\n      Your final answer MUST be the full article of at least 3 paragraphs.\\n      \"},{\"providerData\":{\"id\":\"fc_687d907aff1c819aa01ff212a9a5776f04a7a980e36ab325\",\"type\":\"function_call\"},\"id\":\"fc_687d907aff1c819aa01ff212a9a5776f04a7a980e36ab325\",\"type\":\"function_call\",\"callId\":\"call_MNAhWdegy0jBQ6swL7K3KIYl\",\"name\":\"transfer_to_blog_manager\",\"status\":\"completed\",\"arguments\":\"{}\"},{\"type\":\"function_call_result\",\"name\":\"transfer_to_blog_manager\",\"callId\":\"call_MNAhWdegy0jBQ6swL7K3KIYl\",\"status\":\"completed\",\"output\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"{\\\"assistant\\\":\\\"blog manager\\\"}\"}},{\"providerData\":{},\"id\":\"msg_687d907bd1cc819abef893069a0cc32704a7a980e36ab325\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"status\":\"completed\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"output_text\",\"text\":\"**Understanding Agentic Behavior in Humans and Artificial Intelligence**\\n\\nAgentic behavior, defined by autonomy, self-direction, and independent decision-making, underpins both our daily interactions as humans and the evolution of advanced artificial intelligence systems.
