Instead of being just a large language model that answers questions based on pre-existing knowledge, an agent is an application that can:\n\n- Observe the world (including real-time data)\n- Use tools like APIs, databases, and external systems\n- Take autonomous actions (not needing step-by-step instructions)\n- Plan, reason, and execute tasks to reach goals\n\nThe whitepaper uses analogies (like a chef gathering info, planning, and cooking) to describe agent “cognitive architectures.” It compares \"models\" (which answer based on known data) with \"agents\" (which also use tools and can act and plan in the world).\n\n---\n\n## Article/Section 2: The Tools and Techniques of Agents\n\nThe bulk of the paper is about how agents use three main kinds of tools to extend their abilities:\n\n- **Extensions**: These are bridges between agents and external APIs (e.g., book a flight, get real-time weather). Developers can set up Extensions so agents know how and when to use them.\n- **Functions**: For cases where the developer wants more control, the agent can generate parameters for a function (e.g., format data as JSON), but the function is executed client-side or in a different application layer. Very useful for control, batch operations, or when agents shouldn't (or can't) call APIs directly.\n- **Data Stores**: These allow agents to access new, up-to-date information—like PDFs, websites, or documents—often through \"vector databases\" that let them search and retrieve relevant info at runtime.\n\nThe paper also discusses **agent orchestration** frameworks like ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts, which help the agent reason, plan, and make decisions as it works towards its goals. There are practical examples (with Python code!) showing how to use libraries like LangChain to quickly create an agent that answers complex, multi-step user queries using multiple tools.\n\nThe final sections discuss putting all this into production using the Vertex AI platform—a set of managed Google tools for building, deploying, and improving agents at scale.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR:  \nThis whitepaper explains how Google envisions, builds, and deploys modern AI agents by combining large language models with external tools, APIs, and data access—so they’re able to act, plan, and deliver much more complex results than traditional models.\n\nIf you meant another file or have a second article to compare, just upload it and I'll summarise and contrast both!",
